### What **is** Flutter?
- First of all, let's talk a bit about Flutter. It is a cross-platform framework developed by Google, meaning it allows us to use the same codebase for an application that can run on multiple operating systems (iOS, Android, Fuchsia, MacOS etc.) and the web. Flutter uses **Dart** as its main programming language. The Dart syntax is clean and looks similar to Java, while sharing certain useful features with languages like JavaScript and C# (for example, the `async`/`await` combo, with `Future`s in Dart being similar to `Promise`s and `Task`s in JavaScript and C# respectively).
